## CryptoZombies Contracts
This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts developed during the CryptoZombies course.

## Course Summary
The CryptoZombies course is an interactive tutorial that teaches the basics of Solidity and smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Key Takeaways from Lesson 5:
Tokens and ERC721 Standard: We explored the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and how they apply to our zombie assets.
Libraries: We learned how to use libraries in Solidity for code reusability.
SafeMath Library: We integrated the SafeMath library to prevent overflows and underflows in our smart contracts.
Commenting with NatSpec: We covered the importance of commenting code using the NatSpec standard for better readability and documentation.

## Contracts
Here are the Solidity contracts developed during the course:

ZombieFactory.sol: The main contract for creating new zombies.
ZombieFeeding.sol: Handles zombie feeding logic and DNA combination.
ZombieHelper.sol: Provides additional functionalities like changing the zombie's name and level-up mechanism.
ZombieAttack.sol: Contains the battle mechanics between zombies.
ZombieOwnership.sol: Implements ERC721 standard functions for transferring zombie ownership.
